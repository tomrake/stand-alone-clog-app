* The Purpose
This is a Common lisp project to build stand alone apps that include [[https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog][CLOG]].
My focus is on Windows and I largely use SBCL.

This project went through a few hours to find example [[https://github.com/rabbibotton/clog][CLOG]] code and build an app that worked  under emacs and slime.
The next part was to understand and use the system [[https://github.com/Shinmera/deploy][deploy]] to build a binary.
The next phase was to debug the binary to build a working binary.

This process was more complex than it first seemed.

The principle motivation for this site  is to disclose the detailed tricks I used.
