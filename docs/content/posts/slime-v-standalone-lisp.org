As a mentioned before slime keeps the lisp process running.
But what does the stand-alone binary do, its simply quits and cleans up the lisp threads.

The tutorial code I copied starts the browser defines the handlers and then quits.
I need to have code stay alive to host the handlers.

How this should be done is now a consideration

- The quick and dirty sleep loop seems to work.
- A condition system restartable looping could also work.
- In may be possible to wrap the starup routine in a restartable system.
  - alternatively there could be a stand-alone-startup.
