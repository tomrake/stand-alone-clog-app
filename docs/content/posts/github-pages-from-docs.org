#+TITLE: Github Pages From Docs
#+DATE: 2023-07-27T14:10:36-04:00


This is a prototype repository which hosts Github Pages from the "docs" folder of the project.

This is the hugo step of the build workflow in hugo.yml.

#+begin_src json
      - name: Build with Hugo
        env:
          # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules
          HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production
          HUGO_ENV: production
        run: |
          hugo \
            --debug \
            --source "docs" \
            --destination "../public" \
            --minify \
            --baseURL "${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/"
#+end_src

My workflow yugo.yml was derived from the one suggested for Hugo by Github.
I merely changed the --source and --destination values to build from docs and put the resulting pages when the upload-pages-artifact@v2 could find them.

Why didn't I modify the Upload artifcat step instead?
The version I created works.
