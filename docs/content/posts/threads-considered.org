* Threads of execution

** Under emacs/slime

SBCL when run under slime, is run as an inferrior lisp,
which means it is controled by emacs.
Emacs uses thread to syncronize the REPL and the running lisp process.

slime keeps the lisp process running so if that process creates threads to anwser net work events those event will be answered.

** CLOG
CLOG uses thread to syncronize the clog lisp model with that of the user interface on the browser.

** deploy
It is best to run deploy from ASDF if multiple threads are runing in lisp image deploy will fail to build.

* Testing plan
- Develop the app under emacs/slime and get the correct behaviour.
- Test the same behaviour under a stand alone lisp - I run one under rlwrap.
- Build the app under a stand alown lisp and create the binary.
- Test the binary - be sure no app instance is still serving content from emacs/slime
  - You want to have the built binary server the content.
