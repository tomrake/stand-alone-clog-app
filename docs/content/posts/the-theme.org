The theme m10c-twr is a commont theme for my various hugo sites.
My theme is inserted in the hugo site as a submodule.
This theme has custom icon added to the feather icons.

The feather icons are svg elements that are stroked with a site determined color.
I wished to have other branded icons for my social links.
There is a file in  the theme that contains a json statement of a dictionary where the key is the name and the values svg expressions.
m10c inserts these icons in the side bar inside of svg drawing which defined the color of the strokes.

To add a custom icon I have been able to override the stroke color and add and scale other svg icon code.
The entire purpuse of the separate  theme is to change this one file.
