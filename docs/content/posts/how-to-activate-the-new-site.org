In the best case the new site just builds.
But I believe the github pages need to be activated.

The next part is converting to your projects site.
This documentation will be active in the new site.
To remove it you could delete the entire folder context/posts or delete all the posts.
You will likely need to have a local hugo setup to allow local development of your site.

This post will likely be revised with the actual activation instructions.
